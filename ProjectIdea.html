								<h3>VR Education 

								</h3>
								<h5>———Let students from all over the world gather to enjoy more vivid courses!</h5>
								<p>VR technology is developing recently, VR technology is applying on gaming and many other areas. However, education is a good way to use VR technology. VR education can help students who live in the different country can have the same education. and VR technology can make the teaching process vividly to encourage students have more interest on learning. VR is also a project can help students who are disability or injured. Can also study at home and join social activities. Can include all different students in the classroom and can build confidence for all the students. All the students in the class VR class also can be provide a live experience to the students to make them understand what they learn better.  </p>

								<p>There are several purposes that we are using VR technology in education. VR technologies shorten the distances between each student. The university like RMIT have students from many different countries, students in another country is bothered by just looking at the screen and have no face-to-face communication with other students and teachers. And this is the situation students complained during the pandemic period. VR technology can greatly change this situation, people can meet each other’s in virtual classroom, and teachers also can teach the classes in “face-to-face”. VR technology also can bring students in a scenario or aa experiences make students is experiencing with the specific thing. This will greatly be engaging students and make students enjoyed the class.</p>

								<p>The VR education project will include different modules to satisfied education and socializing needs. The first module would be the classroom module. All students will access by a code to get in a classroom. What the classroom look like will exactly as the university’s classroom. And all the students can choose a seat just like the reality and people can talk and doing exercises just like the reality. The chat channel could be a group chat or just chat with the people you want. And this should be a private chat. This function will make students feels like they are in a real class. Also, system will provide a function board to let you take notes, search the internet, share information with others and etc. in the classroom teacher can load a story or a scenario to make students play a character in the story or scenario. For example, teacher want student students can know what racist affecting and black people is, students will play a character with that background, and after they experienced, they will know better on the racist problem. We can make the education more meaningful, make students truly think about these questions not just reading slogan. Also, students who learning how to do surgery, can do the surgery again and again and even we can the surgery with the special condition. Under the practice students can get many experiences. And for engineering students, they are doing an experiment they can recording every second’s data even more specific. For students learning history, it will be forgettable if you “involved in history.” You will remember well about that part of history because you “experience” it. And for students who learning the structure of a species or a machine, it can show you step by step, how to assemble a machine or what is what is on the creature. For the students have a group task, they can create an activity room or just invite others in a scenario. Students can do the practice again and again until they familiar with that. Students also can apply a one-on-one time with professor. And for students who are learning a language, you can have a communication with a native speaker, so you will learn quicker on that language and more confident when they are speaking that language, because they always talk to native speaker.  So, these functions can support students have a high-quality study even they cannot in the campus. School also can hold activities in the VR education like formal party and orientation. Although we can no eat and drink anything in the VR education. However, there are more way to showing wonderful shows. Also, we can have assembly in VR education. Also, students can join more clubs such as music clubs or movie clubs. Students will love to spend time on club activities, because movie will not just be movie, it will about the experiences. Also, for sports clubs, students can experience how is famous player play the game, what position they run, where they pass the ball.</p>

								<p>The VR education should install at the PC, so all the information and data will be saved on your laptop or desktop, but you can only run the application when you are access to a VR glasses and a VR handle set. And you also need a microphone. VR glasses is the devise take you to the visual world, can make you look at what happening and help you to listen the voice from the video or other’s talking. And the VR handle set can help students to operate the machine to use different functions. Microphone is help you communicate with others.</p>

								<p>If I want to develop this project, I need to learn Video editing, 3D Modelling and proficiency in creating VR content with the available resources. For 3D programming engines I may need: Web VR, which is an experimental JavaScript-powered API, A-Frame and Vizor web frameworks, Unreal Engine- This uses the C++ programming language and Blueprints OOP visual scripting language, Unity 3D that uses PlayMaker and C# visual scripting language and Google VR SDK. And I also have to have a Knowledge of various device specifications and hardware and Experience in operating wearables such as HTC VIVE, Oculus, and HoloLens. </p>

								<p>If the project is successful, more students will have more interest on study, because the teaching method become more vividly. Students from the whole world can have a communication. Students will get more knowledge and experiences because of the VR technology. Also, can build a good study community for those students who are disability and injured. Can bring them confident and more friends. And teacher will be easier to explain something to students. Virtual reality technology will greatly increase student participation and learning. The VR experience will inspire a new generation of young people and smart students to prepare for innovation and change the world.</p>
